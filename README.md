The Number One game about Number One.

Also known as Mensroom Chess, the site to play it is [harrypujols.com/urinal-checkmate](http://harrypujols.com/urinal-checkmate).

## Objective
You're in the men's room. You need to pee.

## Rules
If you're a man, you already know the rules.

But here's a reminder:

- You must *not* stand in an urinal next to another guy.
- You make a checkmate when you stand in a urinal that forces the hypotetical next person in line to stand next to another guy.
- This is what it should look like:
